# Wallpapers
My wallpapers folder. Each folder is a different source, and I have picked what I think are the best ones from each source. Think of it as a best-of for each one.

I picked them by what looks cool. Pretty simple.

Note: the dark and light folders do not have any different wallpapers in them, it is just a collection of some of the wallpapers for if you want a dark background or a light background. Or you could use all of them like me.

If you have any good ones to submit, make an issue. with high-res files of the image.

If you plan to use these, I recommend having them in some kind of slideshow.

I will continue to add more wallpapers and sources as I find them.

**Enjoy!**
